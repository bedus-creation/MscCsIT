\section*{Abstract}
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a network based on statistical learning models which implements machine learning techniques where algorithms can learn from and make prediction on data. It is used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown.
 The network connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.
 
Logic gate is an idealized, or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. Implementation of logic gate refers to building ANN model to simulate logic gates. ANN model is trained with label data of input and outputs, later this model will be used to prediction.
